# /tdd

Invokes the **tdd-guide** agent to enforce test-driven development methodology.

## What This Command Does

1. **Scaffold Interfaces** - Define types/interfaces first
2. **Generate Tests First** - Write failing tests (RED)
3. **Implement Minimal Code** - Write just enough to pass (GREEN)
4. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green (REFACTOR)
5. **Verify Coverage** - Ensure 80%+ test coverage

## When to Use

Use `/tdd` when:
- Implementing new features
- Adding new functions/components
- Fixing bugs (write test that reproduces bug first)
- Refactoring existing code
- Building critical business logic

## TDD Cycle

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → REPEAT

RED:      Write a failing test
GREEN:    Write minimal code to pass
REFACTOR: Improve code, keep tests passing
REPEAT:   Next feature/scenario
```

## Coverage Requirements

- **80% minimum** for all code
- **100% required** for:
  - Financial calculations
  - Authentication logic
  - Security-critical code
  - Core business logic
