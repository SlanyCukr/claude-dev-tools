# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

Examples:
- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in search`
- `refactor: simplify payment processing`
- `docs: update API documentation`
- `test: add E2E tests for checkout`

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

## Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **architect** agent for system design
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Security Review**
   - Use **security-reviewer** agent for sensitive code
   - Check OWASP Top 10
   - Verify no hardcoded secrets

5. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format

## Branch Naming

```
feature/description
fix/description
refactor/description
docs/description
```

## Git Safety

- NEVER force push to main/master
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify)
- NEVER commit secrets
- Create backup branch before risky operations
- Use atomic commits (one logical change per commit)

## Agent Support

- **architect** - System design before implementation
- **tdd-guide** - Test-driven development
- **code-reviewer** - Code quality review
- **security-reviewer** - Security audit
